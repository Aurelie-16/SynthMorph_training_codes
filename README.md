# Tests_with_SynthMorph
This directory contains the code I used during my internship at KTH Royal Institute Technology in Flemingsberg to see how SynthMorph reacts with images from the projection data domain and the code I used to see if it was possible to train SynthMorph with this same kind of data.

To carry out these tests, I used the Synthmorph demo code, which can be found at the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GjpjkhKGrg5W-cvZVObBo3IoIUwaPZBU?usp=sharing
In all the code where sinograms are generated, I used the foreward projection operator from a public GitHub: https://github.com/odlgroup/odl/blob/master/examples/tomo/filtered_backprojection_cone_2d.py
